### workshop task notes:

- i decided that i wanted to create a group of three different buttons that each randomly spawn a different character from psychonauts, one of my other favourite video games
- i decided to figure out how to make an image into a button and with the help of the p5.js forums, i found a very simple way to do so
- i designed my own simple buttons in photoshop, using a similar font to the font of the game for aesthetic reasons
- one thing i really struggled with was figuring out how to optimise the locations of the buttons as i wanted them centered within the window no matter what size the window was
- eventually after some math and problem solving i found a good solution, though there probably is a more simple one
- i also learnt how to make it so the curser turns into a pointer when hovering over the buttons so that it truly looks like a button you would generally see
- i tried to use the windowResized function as well but it only seems to work some of the time and iâ€™m not too sure why
- i tried to figure out how to use an image as the background as well but whenever i tried the canvas seemed to have a lot of trouble reloading, so i might try it for a future project
